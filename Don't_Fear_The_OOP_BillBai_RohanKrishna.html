	Intro: Here we explain Java and Object-Oriented programming using the example of a superhero town. For a basic
	definition to help you understand the concept, think of Object-Oriented programming as a way of executing tasks with
	information provided by a reference to an object (remember, an object can be anything).<br/><br/>

	</span><br/>
	The above <B>class</B> is a template for a <font color="FF0000"> SuperheroTown </font> <B>object</B>, or a template
	for creating a Superhero town on Earth. This code tells us that any object of SuperheroTown, or that any superhero
	town on Earth, has a few key traits which can have different values. For example, different towns will have
	different number of coffee shops. In the code, <B>int</B> <font color="FF0000">headquarters</font> is a
	<B>variable</B>. The <B>keyword</B> int tells us that the variable will store an integer, and
	<font color="FF0000">headquarters</font> is the name of the variable. <br/><br/>
	In the code under <font color="FF0000">public SuperheroTown()</font>, we set the number of headquarters to 5 and the
	location to Earth for ALL superhero towns created by this template, because all superhero towns are on Earth and
	they all must have 5 headquarters. They also all exist in the year 2500. This code is written in the
	<B>constructor</B>, indicated by the keyword <B>public</B>, followed by the name of the class. The constructor is
	what creates an object based on the template and <B>initializes</B> values for the declared variables.<br/><br/>
	Now we know the key traits of a superhero town and the values of some of the traits when an object is created based
	on the class SuperheroTown. We can now go ahead and set other values for objects of class SuperheroTown. Then we
	will be able to manipulate these objects for our code to actually do something, to complete a task.<br/><br/>
	Let us begin the storyline, or the task that is to be done by the code.<br/><br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		The conflict at Starbucks coffee bar. This story takes place in a superhero town called Towntington. Towntington
		has five superheroes, thirty coffee bars, and five villains. <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		Main Conflict <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superhero Town Towntington is a new Superhero Town. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of coffee bars in Towntington is fifteen. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of superheroes is five. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of villains is five. <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public class Conflict { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main (String arguments[]) { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SuperheroTown towntington = new SuperheroTown; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towntington.coffeeBars = 30; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towntington.superheroes = 5; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towntington.villains = 5; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
		} <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	Our plot begins by creating setting some basic values to establish the setting of our storyline. An object of class
	SuperheroTown is created by using the keyword <B>new</B> as shown in the code. This would call the constructor,
	which creates the object. Some unique values are assigned to variables of <font color="FF0000">towntington</font>,
	which is the created object of <font color="FF0000">SuperheroTown</font>. All of this is done in class
	<font color="FF0000">Conflict</font>. Just as we needed a template for superhero towns on Earth, we need a template
	for conflicts in these towns. This class will contain some information which we refer to in developing our
	storyline. Using multiple classes helps keep code easy to read and organized. <br/> <br/>
	Now let’s add another element to our story. Of course, we couldn’t have a superhero town without a superhero. <br/>
	<br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		All humans start out with 2 legs, 2 arms and 1 nose. They are either male or female and they have a name. They
		also have a food that they carry on themselves. If asked for their name, they will reveal their name. <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		Human <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a name <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain gender <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a food in their pocket <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain number of legs <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain number of arms <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain number of noses <br/>
		A standard human would start with  <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 legs <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 arms <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 nose <br/>
		When asked for name <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say name <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public class Human <br/>
		{ <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String name; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String gender; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String currentFoodOnThem; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int legs; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int arms; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int noses; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Human() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int legs = 2; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int arms = 2; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int noses = 1; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public String whatIsYourName() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return name; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
		} <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	Now we have a template to create humans. Every human will have some key traits. Some of these traits will have a
	definite, set value, such as number of <font color="FF0000">legs</font>. Other traits will have values assigned
	later because not all humans are identical. You can interact with the human by asking for a name. The name is
	returned in something called a <B>return method</B>. A return type is indicated when creating a return method.
	In this case it is a <B>String</B>. A return method doesn’t actually output anything, but gives back a value for
	the computer to use elsewhere. <B>Methods</B> are also known as behaviours. <br/> <br/>
	We first create a class Human since our human superhero will inherit the traits and behaviours of a
	<font color="FF0000">human</font>. Now let’s create a superhero. <br/> <br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		All superheroes start out with a cape, two gloves, a mask, and a certain muscle mass. They have different
		powers. <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		Superhero extends the idea of Human. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain number of capes <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain number of gloves   <br/>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a certain muscle mass <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a unique super power <br/>
		A standard superhero would start with <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one cape <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two gloves <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one mask <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 lbs of muscle <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public class Superhero extends Human{ <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int capes; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int gloves; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int masks; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int muscleMass; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String uniqueSuperPower; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Superhero() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capes = 1; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;masks = 1; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gloves = 2; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;muscleMass = 20; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
		} <br/><br/>
	</span>
	In the above code, we used <B>extends</B> to indicate that superheroes are a <B>subclass</B> of Human, and will
	inherit traits of Human in addition to having some other features. Once again we set some initial values and let
	the rest be set once an object is created from the template. <br/> <br/>
	Here is another example of using <B>extends</B>. We are going to add a villain to our story. <br/> <br/>

	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">Villains are based on the idea of humans. They are almost identical, the
		only thing setting them apart is that they have a mustache, a hat, a certain "look", some level of craziness,
		and a certain quantity of “prisoners” taken by them. The standard villain will look evil, start the day out not
		very greedy, and not yet have prisoners in hand. <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		Villain extends the idea of Human. <br/>
		A Villain <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a mustache. <br/>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has some level of craziness. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a certain number of prisoners in their possession. <br/>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will start out with very little craziness. <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will start the day without any prisoners. <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public class Villain extends Human { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String mustacheColor; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String hatColor; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;String look; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int craziness; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int numberOfPrisoners; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human prisoner; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Villain() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look = "Mean"; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;craziness = 1; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numberOfPrisoners = 0; <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
		} <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	Nothing new here, except you may have noticed that we declared a variable as
	<font color="FF0000">Human prisoner</font>. Same concept, <font color="FF0000">Human</font> is the type and
	<font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> is the name of the variable. When you create a class, you also create a data
	type. A String is really an object of a String class and its own data type. You will later see that the variable
	<font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> is really a name used to identify another object of the Human class. <br/> <br/>
	Let’s give our villain some behaviours. Creating methods (behaviours) is how we can manipulate and interact with
	objects to do a task. Take a close look at the next two examples of methods. <br/> <br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		Whenever the main plot says that a villain puts his left over food into the wrong bin, his level of craziness
		will go up by one. <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		putFoodInRecycling <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;craziness increases by one <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		putFoodInRecycling() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;craziness++; <br/>
		} <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	In this method, we add one to the value of craziness whenever our villain puts food in the recycling (villains are
	horrible, aren’t they?). We increment craziness by one by using ++ as shown above. This is a void method, meaning
	that it doesn’t return a value. The following is another method for our villain. <br/><br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		If someone asks a villain how crazy he is, the villain will always respond with his level of craze. <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		howCrazyAmI <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell them how crazy I am <br/><br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public int howCrazyAmI() { <br/>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return craziness; <br/>
		} <br/><br/>
	</span>
	This is a return method. You’ve seen this before, with returning the name of a human. This is no different, except
	our return type is an int. <br/> <br/>
	Now we have one more method for our villain. It isn’t a different type of method, but you will see how our villain
	interacts with another human. Translating that into Java terms, you’ll see how this next method will take in
	information about a created object. <br/> <br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		If the villain is supposed to take in a prisoner, tie up the specified prisoner, add 1 to the number of prisoners he
		has taken, and then print out "Golly! [The specified prisoner] has been tied up!” <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
		takePrisoner(name) <br/>
		add one to the number of prisoners this villain has taken. <br/>
		print "Golly! [The specified prisoner] has been tied up!” <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	<span style="background-color: #FF0000">
		public void takePrisoner(Human prisoner) { <br/>
		this.prisoner = prisoner; <br/>
		numberOfPrisoners++; <br/>
		System.out.println("The Villain has tied up " + prisoner.whatIsYourName()); <br/>
		} <br/> <br/>
	</span>
	This method might seem a little confusing. In the brackets beside the method name, you see
	<font color="FF0000">Human prisoner</font>. This is a <B>parameter</B>. It will be passed when the method is called.
	What <font color="FF0000">Human</font> does when placed in those brackets is that it tells Java that a value is
	being passed and that the value is of type Human. The <B>identifier</B> <font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> tells
	Java what the variable name for that value should be called. Now the method <font color="FF0000">takePrisoner</font>
	has a <B>local variable</B> called <font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> of type Human. Local variables cannot be
	used outside of the method they are declared in. <br/> <br/>
	They <B>reserved word</B> <font color="FF0000">this</font> is used to refer to the variable declared at the top of
	the class, outside any methods (called an <B>instance variable</B>). It is useful when there are local variables and
	instance variables with the same name, although you should generally avoid reusing identifiers (name of a variable,
	object, method, etc.) in code. <br/> <br/>
	Whenever the villain takes a prisoner, the variable <font color="FF0000">numberOfPrisoners</font> increases. Now,
	there is output in this method (indicated by <font color="FF0000">System.out.println</font>), but this is different
	from returning a value, so this is a void method. In the output, there is a String, plus another String returned
	from a method in the Human class. Don’t get confused, <font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> is an object of class
	Human. By writing <font color="FF0000">prisoner.whatIsYourName()</font> we are doing two things. Firstly, we are
	saying that we want to reference code in the class that <font color="FF0000">prisoner</font> belongs to
	(this is class Human). Secondly, we are calling the method <font color="FF0000">whatIsYourName()</font>, which is
	located in class Human and returns a value when called. Since objects of the same class can still be unique, you
	must use <font color="FF0000">prisoner</font>. instead of <font color="FF0000">Human</font>. when making a reference
	. If you wanted all objects of a class to have the same values, you can use the keyword <B>static</B>. If you
	changed the value of any variable of one object, the value of that variable would change for all objects of that
	same class. We will not be explaining exactly how to use static in this tutorial. <br/> <br/>
	Now it’s time for a recap. Let’s take a look at what story our program tells so far. <br/> <br/>
	<span style="background-color: #00FF0C">
		Here is the main plot of the Conflict at Starbucks Coffee Bar: There is a Superhero Town called Towntington.
		Towntington has thirty coffee bars, five superheroes, and five villains. There is a male villain named
		PetitNicolas. PetitNicolas has a red hat, and a grey mustache. PetitNicolas has a leftover brownie in his
		pocket. Ben is a male human, and has some loose salad in his pocket (Why he has it, we will never know).
		In our story, PetitNicolas starts out by throwing a leftover brownie into the recycling bin. He then lets

	In the code above, we had a main method. There should be only one <B>main method</B> out of all the classes used
	in this program. A main method simply tells Java what class to start from and is where the programmer makes use of
	behaviours in the classes to do a task. The behaviours, or methods, are called by making reference to an object
	belonging to the class where the behaviour is located. Now you can see how our storyline come all together. To
	understand OOP, simply remember template (class), object, and reference. Objects are made by referencing a template,
	which is like a recipe. Then the objects are referenced to access values and behaviours. The main advantage of
	having objects in programming is to be able to create as many related objects as wanted while allowing each to be
	unique in the values of their traits. Each object will have a lot of information behind the scenes which helps
	reduce code. So hopefully our superhero town has brought you a few steps closer to understanding OOP. <br/> <br/>
