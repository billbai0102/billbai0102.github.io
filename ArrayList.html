        WHAT IS AN <i>ARRAYLIST</i>?
    </b>
    <br> An ArrayList is very similar to vanilla arrays in the sense that they
    are also data structures that hold elements of a specific type.
    <br><br>
    <b class = "title">
        ARRAYS VS ARRAYLISTS
    </b>
    <br> The difference between ArrayLists and arrays are that ArrayLists have
    variable lengths, unlike the constant length of arrays. When the size of an
    ArrayLists isn't large enough to hold another element, it doubles it's capacity.
    <br> As well, ArrayLists can not hold primitive data types, but rather hold
    the primitive types held in wrapper classes. This is slightly less efficient
    that arrays in some situations, since it will take extra time to unwrap the
    wrapped primitive type, when proccessing.
    <br> Lastly, ArrayLists use methods to alter itself, rather than arrays where
    you access the variable itself to modify it.

        HOW DO I MAKE AN ARRAYLIST?
    </b>
    <br>ArrayLists are declared as such:
</p>
<pre>     ArrayList&lttype&gt name = new ArrayList&lttype&gt()</pre>
<p>
  That means, to declare a String array, you'd do as such:
</p>
<pre>     ArrayList&ltString&gt stringList= new ArrayList&ltString&gt();</pre>
<p>
  Alternatively, if you were to create an ArrayList of BankAccount objects,
  you declare it as such:
</p>
<pre>     ArrayList&ltBankAccount&gt bankAccountList = new ArrayList&ltBankAccount&gt();</pre>
    <p>
      <br><br>
      <b class = "title">WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS ARRAYLIST?</b>
      <br> Just like arrays, you can alter an ArrayList. There are 4 methods
      to alter an ArrayList's state.
    </p>
    <pre>
Firstly, to add an element into an array, you use the add(E element) method.
      stringList.add("Hello");
This would add the String to the end of the ArrayList.
Alternatively, you can also use the overloaded add(int index, E element) method to add an object at a specific location.
      stringList.add("Hello", 1);
This would shift every element after index 1 to the right, and place "Hello" at index 1. HOWEVER - This will throw an error if the index exceeds the size of the ArrayList.
<center>
  <img src="ArrayListAdd.png" alt="Array Diagram" width=50% height=50%>
  The ArrayList add() method
</center>


As well, there is a set(int index, E element) method which replaces the element at index with the new element.
      stringList.set(1, "Bye");
This will replace the second element in the ArrayList with "Bye", and discard the old element.
<center>
  <img src="ArrayListSet.png" alt="ArrayList set() method" width=50% height=50%>
  The ArrayList set() method
</center>

The method remove(int index) will remove the object at the specified index.
      stringList.remove(1);
This will remove the second element, and shrink the size by 1.
As well, there is another method remove(E element) which will remove the first occurence of the specified element, and shrink the size by 1.
<center>
  <img src="ArrayListRemove.png" alt="ArrayList remove() method" width=50% height=50%>
  The ArrayList remove() method
</center>

Lastly, there is the size() method, which will return the number of elements in the array.
      System.out.println(stringList.size()); //Will return the number of elements in stringList.
<center>
  <img src="ArrayListSize.gif" alt="ArrayList size() method" width=50% height=50%>
  The ArrayList size() method. NOTE: The 0.0 is the default value for double types, meaning the 0.0 mark an empty position in the ArrayList.
</center>
</pre>
   <p>
    <b class="title">
        WHEN DO I USE AN ARRAYLIST?
    </b>
    Just like arrays, ArrayLists hold a collection data. One thing ArrayLists
    offer that arrays don't is dynamic size. Rather than creating a new array
    each time more data is added, by using an ArrayList, it auto adjusts for you.
    <br> So in essence, use ArrayLists when working with data with ever changing size
    <br>Common reasons to use ArrayLists are
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Storing values to be <i>sorted</i></li>
        <li>In real life applications, it can hold a bank account information or</li>
        <li>Store student information on a record</li>
        <li>Arrays also allow you to search for a specific element, and perform an operation on it</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <br>
    <b class = "title">
        USING ARRAYLISTS WITH FOR LOOPS
    </b>
    <br>Just like arrays, when working ArrayLists and For loops in tandem, you can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Search an ArrayList</li>
      <li>Sort an ArrayList</li>
      <li>Modify an ArrayList</li>
      <li> AND MORE!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For loops can be used in tandem with ArrayLists to modify the ArrayList, by
      modifying it's state.
    </p>
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Adding elements to a blank ArrayList</th>
        <th colspan="2">Modifying elements in a predetermined ArrayList</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        <pre>
        //Add elements to an array
        ArrayList&ltInteger&gt intArray = new ArraList&ltInteger&gt();
        for(int x = 0; x < 10; x++){
          intArray.add(5); //Adds ten 5s to the ArrayList
        }
        </pre>
        </td>
        <td>
        <pre>

        for(int x = 0; x < stringList.size(); x++){
          stringArray.set(x, "Modified!"); //Sets all elements to "Modified!"
        }
        for(int x = 0; x < stringList.size(); x++){
          stringArray.remove(0); //Removes all elements
        }
        </pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      As you can see, adding and modifying arrays revolve around the basic concept
      of having a for loop that goes from start to end, then using the one of the three
      modifiying method to change it's state.<br><br>
      <b class = "title">
          PASSING ARRAYLISTS AS METHOD PARAMETERS
      </b>
      <br> Just like arrays, ArrayList states can also be altered by a method because
      they are <i> pass by reference </i>.
    </p>
    <br>

    <br><br>
    <p>
    <b class = "title">ANALYSIS</b><br>
    ArrayLists are just like arrays, except a few qualities: firstly, ArrayLists
    use methods to get, set, and remove elements, while arrays only use the
    "=" operator to modify everything. ArrayLists are best used with dynamic-sized
     datasets that are always changing length. This is the one biggest advantage they have over arrays.
    Arrays are better for data sets that don't change size, and deal with primitive
    variables. This is because ArrayLists are less efficient than arrays when working
    with primitive variables since they need to wrap and unwrap primitive variables
    with their wrapper classes.
    </p>
<p>
  <br><br>Tips when working with ArrayLists
  <ul>
      <li>Just like arrays, when finding the last element, remember that it
      is list.size() <b> - 1 </b></li>
      <li>Don't forget ArrayLists are also PASS BY REFERENCE!</li>
      <li>If you know the size stays constant, and you are working with primitive
        data types, it may be better to use an array, due to ArrayList
        inefficiencies when unwrapping wrapper classes</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<b class = "title">PROBLEM: Given this collection: {5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 12, 15}, you must find
  the largest number, then replace all elements in the array with it, then clear the
  list so that it's size is 0.
  <br><br>SOLUTION:
</b>
<pre>
<center>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list.add(5);
list.add(7);
list.add(6);
list.add(8);
list.add(9);
list.add(12);
list.add(15);
int highest = INTEGER_MIN;
for(int x = 0; x < list.size(); x++){
  if(list.get(x) > highest)
    highest = list.get(x);
}
for(int x = 0; x < list.size(); x++){
  list.set(x,highest);
}
int curSize = list.size();
for(int x = 0; x < curSize; x++){
  list.remove(x);
}

How I solved this problem: This problem is like the problem in Arrays tutorial,
but with a twist on it. First, I declared the ArrayList, then manually added
the ints to the ArrayList, since there is no way to initialize and declare an
ArrayList. I then created an int, <i>highest</i> and set it to INTEGER_MIN. I
made a for loop that goes from 0 to list.size() - 1 (remember that size() is
like array.length), then set <i>highest</i> to whichever element came up as
highest. I used the get() method to access the ArrayList. To replace all
elements in the ArrayList, I used the set() method and a for loop to set all
elements to <i>highest</i>. To remove all elements, I first made an int,
<i>curSize</i>, and set it to the list size. I made this int because if you
put list.size() inside of the for loop, since x is always iterating up, and
the size will always be going down (since I am using .remove() method), it
will only run for half the size. I then used a for loop from 0 to
curSize - 1, then used the remove() method to remove all elements from the ArrayList.
